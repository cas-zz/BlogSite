              Hello! I'm Ma. Reina Cassandra Gudalle, a beginner in web development and programming. 
              I am currently in my 3rd year at the Technological University of the Philippines, 
              taking Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I enjoy learning new skills and exploring my creativity.
            </p>
            <p>This blog contains things about me, some of my daily/weekly activities, and my hobbies.</p>
            <p>
              Facts about me: I love cats, especially my cat "Chimi". I love them for being independent yet clingy. 
              I also love the color pink; it’s soothing to my eyes, and most of my belongings are pink.
            </p>

  <p><font color="#CA955C">How I Ended Up in Information Systems</font></p>
  <p>I am really into engineering or architecture course, so I tried to apply at my University
    since it offers the course that I wanted and no tuition fees. As I tried to proceed to the application
    I saw that there are no available slots anymore of the engineering or architecture course. Due to unavailability,
 I tried to apply on BSCS or Computer Science. Unfortunately, I got waitlisted and suddenly received
an e-mail that I got redirected to Information Systems. This is where my programming journey begins.</p>
  
  <p><font color="#CA955C">Challenges and Struggles</font></p>
  <p>Learning programming was not easy in the beginning. I remember the first time I tried 
    C, my code was full of errors, and I couldnt figure out what went wrong. I spent hours on 
    one tiny issue only to realize I missed a semicolon. But those small victories, like successfully 
    debugging my first error or making a button actually do something, kept me motivated. I also found 
    some great resources like W3Schools, which broke down concepts in a way I could understand.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <div class="hobbies-content">
        <p><font color="#CA955C">Cooking</font></p>
        <p>Whenever I have free time I will cook, I also try experimenting in cooking like mixing some few ingredients
          if which tastes better. It’s a fun way to learn new techniques and keep things interesting in the kitchen
